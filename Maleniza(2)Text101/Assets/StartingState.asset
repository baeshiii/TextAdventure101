  storyText: 'Festers. Everywhere. Armed mostly with gas-powered rock flingers.

    At
    least 10 of them are guarding the hangar door. Typical.


    Could try punching
    my way through, beating ''em. Or sneaking the long way to the emergency exit,
    quietly.


    What should I do?

    1. Take them head on, rush and fight the
    10 guards.

    2. Sneak my way into the emergency exit quietly.'
