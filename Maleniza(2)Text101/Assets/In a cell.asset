  storyText: 'Well, you tried but it was a little bit stupid. You sustained a brutal
    beating and ended up in a dirty cell. The bars are thick cast iron. The door
    is old and patched together with plate metal and thick red wires.


    You have
    no idea where you are, and your head hurts


    So, what to do now?


    1.
    Wait it out and rest. My head really hurts

    2. Slam into the door with all
    my might'
